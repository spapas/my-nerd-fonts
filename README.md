# my-nerd-fonts
This repo has some nerd fonts (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) that I use.

These fonts have the following characteristics:

* They support greek
* They look good (at least for me)
* They work in vim / gvim
* They work with windows command line (cmd)

Install them and then select then in gvim and cmd.
